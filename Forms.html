<!-- 
The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input. 
The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, 
    such as - text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.  
-->

<!-- The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button. -->
<!-- When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on what user has entered before. -->
<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">  

<!-- The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements. 
The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, 
because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element.
The 'for' attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the 'id' attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.
The name attribute acts as the key in a key-value pair, where the value the selected option or input data.
If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all to server.
